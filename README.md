# Restaurant Management System

## Overview
The **Restaurant Management System** is a console-based Java application that enables restaurant staff to manage menu items, take customer orders, track order history, and update order statuses efficiently. The system automates order processing, payment handling, and customer management.

## Features
- **Menu Management**: Display, add, and manage dishes in the restaurant's menu.
- **Order Handling**: Place customer orders, calculate total price, and track order status.
- **Customer Management**: Store customer details and maintain order history.
- **Order Processing**: Update orders as "Completed" or "Canceled" with payment handling.
- **Order Lookup**: View current and past orders per customer.

## System Workflow
1. The system starts with a predefined menu.
2. The user interacts through a menu-driven interface.
3. Customers place orders by selecting dishes.
4. Orders are stored, and staff can update their status.
5. Payments are processed when marking orders as completed.
6. Customer order history is maintained for future reference.

## Installation & Usage
